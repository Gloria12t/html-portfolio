<h1>My all time favourites of #aManiratnamFilm</h1>
<h2>I am sharing with you the ones I enjoyed watching a lot </h2>
<hr />
<h3>Alaipayuthey</h3>
<p>This is a feel-good movie which I will rewatch  100 times to imitate the dialogues  </p>
<h3>O Kadhal Kanmani</h3>
<p>This one is a chill movie that I watch for the music and for the cinematography. Everything in the frame was so beautiful at every second throughout the movie, and the dialogues, as always, were short and crisp.</p>
<h3>Guru</h3>
<p>This movie's sountrack will forever be in my playlis.</p>
